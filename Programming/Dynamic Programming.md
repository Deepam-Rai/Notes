> **Dynamic programming**: Method to solve problems efficiently by breaking down problems into subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

Criteria for the problem to be apt for DP:
1. **Optimal substructure:** The problem can be broken down into smaller, overlapping subproblems and the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to the subproblems.
2. **Overlapping subproblems:** The same subproblems are encountered multiple times during computation.
