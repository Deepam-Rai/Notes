### Relation
$If\ R\subset A\times B \ then\ R:A->B$

### Function
$If\ a=b\ thenf(a)=f(b)$.

#### Bijective functions
One-to-one and onto.
- Inverse of bijective is also bijective.
- Composition of bijective is also bijective.

### Equivalence Relation
1. Reflexive: $xRx\  \forall x$
2. Symmetric: $xRy<=>yRx\ \forall x,y$.
3. Transitive: $xRy\ and\ yRz\ => xRz\ \forall\ x,y,z$.
