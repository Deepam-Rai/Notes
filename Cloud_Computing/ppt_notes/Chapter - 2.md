Reasons for migration to cloud:
1. Cost saving
2. Licensing issue
3. Pricing of the cloud services

More advantages given in [first chapter](./Chapter%20-%201%20Introduction.md).  

7 steps:
1. Assesment
	1. Assesment of issues relating to migration at application, code, design, architecture, usage level.
	2. Proof of concept, pricing details.
2. Isolate
	1. Isolation of environmental and systemic dependencies of the enterprise application within the captive data.
	2. Better understanding of the complexity of migration.
3. Map
	1. Map construct that separates the components that should reside in the captive data center and ones that should go to cloud.
4. Re-Architect
	1. Re-architect and implement in cloud.
	2. Can affect functionalities of the application.
	3. Some functionalities might be lost.
5. Augment
	1. Augment the application using the features of cloud computing services.
6. Test
	1. Validate and test application.
	2. New test cases due to augmentation and proof-of-concepts are also tested.
7. Optimize
	1. Optimize and reiterate 7 steps to make migration robust and comprehensive.

Migration Risks:
1. How effectively migration risks are identified and mitigated?
	1. Testing step identifies key migration risks.
	2. Optimization step addresses approaches to mitigate.
2. Types:
	1. General Migration Risks
		1. performance monitoring, business continuity and disaster recovery.
		2. compliance with standards and government issues.
		3. QOS(Quality of Service) parameters
		4. portability and interoperability issues
		5. handling migration failures
	2. Security related risks
		1. Trust and privacy.
		2. legal compliances
		3. multi tenancy and impact of IT data leakage.
