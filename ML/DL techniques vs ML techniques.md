| Scope:                    | ML is broader field including various techniques for building models from data. | DL is subset of ML that uses neural networks to build models from data. |
| Feature engineering:      | Relies on manually designed features by domain experts.                         | Automatically extracts features from training data.                     |
| Data Dependency:          | Performs well on smaller datasets.                                              | Requires large amount of data.                                          |
| Computational complexity: | Relatively less compute expensive.                                              | Relatively, highly compute expensive.                                   |
| Interpretability:         | Relatively interpretable.                                                       | Very less interpretability, often referred as "black boxes".            |
| Examples:                 | Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Tress, KNN, Random forest, etc                 | CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformers, etc.                                      |
