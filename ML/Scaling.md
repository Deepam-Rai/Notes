When the range of values for some feature is too large compared other features, they might disproportionately influence the performance of certain algorithms. To mitigate this bias, we can scale these features to bring them within a similar range as other features.

Pros:
1. Performance might improve.
	
Cons:
1. Interpretability decreases.
