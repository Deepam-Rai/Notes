Traditionally, the old Upanishads had their place in the Brahmanas and  ranyakas. There is only one instance of a Samhita containing Upanishad – the Vajasaneyi Samhita comprises the Ishavasya Upanishad forming the 40th Book. In later times, the Upanishads obtained a more independent position but still they professed to belong more particularly to one or the other of the four Vedas.

They represent the knowledge of Brahman (Brahma-Vidya). What is this world? Who am I? What becomes of me after death? – Such questions are asked and answered in these Upanishads.

## Brahmasutras
Texts that systematizes and summarizes the philosophical and spiritual ideas in the Upanishads in aphoristic form. It is attributed to sage Badarayana or Veda Vyasa or Krishna Dvaipayana. It is also known as Vedanta Sutra, Shariraka Sutra and Bhiksu Sutra(literal: Sutras for monks or mendicants).
It has been influential to various Indian philosophies but interpreted differently by them.
The definition of Sutras states that a Sutra has very few words, free from
ambiguity, meaningful, multi-faceted, free from excess verbiage and any
flaws.  

It consists 555 aphoristic verses.  

The Brahmasutra is divided into 4 chapters and each chapter into 4 quarters or sub-chapters. Each quarter(Pada) is divided into a number of Adhikaranas, a unit of subject matter consisting of one or more sutras.
The four chapters are:
1. First Chapter: Metaphysics of absolute Reality.
2. Second Chapter: Addresses objections raised by prevailing philosophies(Nyaya, Yoga, Vaisheshika, Mimasa, ...)
3. Third Chapter: Epistemology and path to gaining spiritually liberating knowledge.
4. Fourth Chapter: Significance of such knowledge.

The surviving commentaries on Brahma Sutras are bhasyas by Adi Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhvacharya, Bhaskara, Vallabhacharya, Vijnanabhiksu, Nimbarkacharya, Baladeva and many others.  
Often a sutra or adhikarana is divided and considered as multiple and thus some variances in their count arises. Thus different commentators too recognize different number of sutras, nevertheless the count difference is reasonable.
