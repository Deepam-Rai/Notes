# Slokas

> Uddharedaatma naatmaanam naatmaanam avasaadayet
      Aatmaiva hyaatmano bandhuhu aatmaiva ripuraatmanaha

Man should raise himself by his own self. He should not degrade himself. Because, his own self is his friend and own self is his enemy.

>KarmaNyevaadhikaaraste Maa phaleShu kadaachana
     Maa karma phala hetur bhoohoo maate sangostwa karmaNi

You have the right to work, but do not crave for the fruits of actions or works.
Let not be the fruits of action, your motive. At the same time the Lord warns us that on account of this do not give up action and become chronically inactive.
