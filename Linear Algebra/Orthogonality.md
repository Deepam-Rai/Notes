> Orthogonality = perpendicular $\implies$ independent

- Linear independence $\centernot \implies$ orthogonality

> **Orthogonal vectors:** are mutually perpendicular set of vectors.

> **Orthonormal basis:** Basis set is a set of orthogonal vectors.

> **Orthogonal subspaces:** $V$ and $W$ are said to be orthogonal subspaces if $x^Ty=0, \forall x \in V, y \in W$.

Example: xy plane and xz plane, axes, x axis to yz plane, etc.
- $V=${zero vector} is a subspace orthogonal to every other subspace.
- If basis vectors are orthogonal, then vector spaces are orthogonal.

> **Orthogonal Complement:** Space of all vectors orthogonal to $V$, denoted as $V^\perp$.


Test of orthogonality: 
1. $v_1.v_2=0$
2. $v_1^Tv_2=0$
