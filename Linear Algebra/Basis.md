Prerequisite:
1. [Vector Space](./Vector%20Space.md)
2. 

> **Span:** set of all vectors obtained from linear combination of given set of vectors.

> **Basis = Span + Linear Independence**  
> The set of vectors $w_1,w_2,...,w_n$ such that
> 1. they span vector space $V$
> 2. they are linearly independent.

- There is only one linear combination for each $v \in V$ with respect to basis.
- Basis need not be unique, but number of vectors is equal in all.
- Any invertible square matrix of dimension $n \times n$ forms basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

> **Dimension:** The number of vectors in the basis of a vector space.
- Less than this number cannot span the vector space.
- More than this number will not be independent.

We check $C(A)$ to see the span of column vectors of matrix.  
And $N(A)$ to see the linear independence of column vectors of matrix.
