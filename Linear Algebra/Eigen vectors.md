>**Eigen vectors:** Vectors that continue in the same span even after applying transformation T.

$$\large Ax=\lambda x \implies (A-\lambda I)x=0$$

- not linear as there are 2 unknowns ($\lambda,x$)
- $x \in N(A-\lambda I)$

### Finding eigen vectors
1. Find eigen values by solving $det(A-\lambda I)=0$
2. Find eigen vectors by solving $(A-\lambda I)x=0$
