In Gaussian Elimination#TODO put link, for square matrix:  
$A \to U \to I$  
transformation takes place. for rectangular matrices following takes place:  
$A \to U\text{(row echelon form)} \to R\text{(reduced row echelon form)}$  

Rectangular matrices can be used for [solving simultaneous system of equations](./Solving%20Ax=b.md).

---

Let $A$ be $m \times n$ matrix.  
$r =$ rank of the matrix,  
$r =$ no. of pivot columns,  
$r =$ no. of pivot columns,  
$m-r =$ no. of zero rows,  
$m-r =$ no. of conditions to be satisfied,  
$n-r =$ no. of free variables,  
$n-r =$ no. of special solutions in $N(A)$,
