$A = m\times n$ dimensional matrix,  
$C(A) =$ Column space of A,  
$C(A^T) =$ Row space of A,  
$N(A) =$ Null space of A,  
$N(A^T) =$ Null space of $A^T$,  
$r =$ no. of pivot elements in $A$, $r \le m, r \le n$,

$\therefore$  
$r =$ no. of pivot cols = no. of pivot rows,  
$r$ pivot columns forms basis of $C(A)$,  
$r$ pivot rows forms basis of $C(A^T)$,  
$C(A) = r$ dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$,  
$C(A^T) = r$ dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$,  
$N(A) = n-r$ dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$,  
$N(A^T) = m-r$ dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$,  

$R =$ row echelon form of $A$,  
$U =$ upper dimensional form of $A$,  
then,  
$N(R)=N(U)=N(R)$ as row operations maintains linear systems,   

$C(A^T) = C(U^T) = C(R^T)$ as row operations transforms rows using linear combination of other rows,    
$C(A), C(U), C(R)$ need not be same as row operations breaks columns,
