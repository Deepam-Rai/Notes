> **Vector space:** a set of vectors that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.

Let,  
$M$ be a vector space,  
$V, V_1, V_2 \in M$,  
then,  
1. $V_1+V_2 \in M$
2. $cV \in M$ for $c \in \mathbb{R}$

Properties:
1. Is commutative: $A+B=B+A$
2. Is associative: $A+(B+C)=(A+B)+C$
3. Unique Zero vector exists such that, $V+0=V, \forall V \in M$
4. Additive inverse: $V+(-V)=0, \forall V \in M$
5. Identity element of scalar multiplication: $1V=V, \forall V \in M$
6. Distributive in scalar multiplication: $c(V_1+V_2)=cV_1+cV_2, \forall V_1,V_2 \in M, c \in \mathbb{R}$
7. Distributive in scalar addition: $(c_1+c_2)V=c_1V+c_2V, \forall c_1,c_2 \in \mathbb{R}, V \in M$

> **Subspace:** of a vector space is a non-empty subset such that it is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.

It should contain zero vector.
Examples: Line in $R^2$, Plane in $R^3$, Zero in $R^n$, lower triangular matrices in $n \times n$ matrices, symmetric matrices in $n \times n$ matrices, etc.

Let $A$ = $m \times n$ matrix.  

> **Column space C(A)**: Set of all linear combinations of column vectors of the matrix.
- subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$.


> **Row space**: Set of all linear combinations of row vectors of the matrix.
- subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

> **Null Space N(A):** Set of vectors $x$ such that $Ax=0$.
- subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
