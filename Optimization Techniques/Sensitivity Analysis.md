The parameters can change within certain limits without changing the optimum. Sensitivity analysis is the study of this.  

1. Sensitivity of the optimum solution to the changes in availability of resources(RHS of constraints).
2. Sensitivity of the optimum solution to the changes in unit profit or unit cost(coefficients of objective function, thus slope).

> dual/shadow price = unit worth of a resource

> feasibility range: The range in which we can increase/decrease the resource with the dual price of resource remaining same.

Tells:
1. When increasing/decreasing the resources which one should be given more priority?
	1. Decide according to the dual price.
2. Should we increase the capacity of the resources?
	1. If the additional net revenue given by resource per hour is less than additional investment to increase the resource per hour, then don't increase.
3. How much can we increase a resource capacity, given other resource capacity is constant?
	1. Graphically we can see, as we increase the resource capacity the plotted line of that resource moves, we can tell how much it will affect optimum revenue till we extend it under feasible region itself. If it goes outside the feasibility region it would require more analysis.

(2)
Changing coefficient changes the slope of the line corresponding to that resource.  

> optimality range: the range in which we can change the slope with optimum remaining same.

Tells:
1. Whether changing the unit revenue for products changes the optimum?
	1. Changing unit revenue is changing the coefficients which changes the slope, if the change is within optimality range then optimum remains same.
